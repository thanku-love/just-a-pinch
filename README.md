In this game, you will control a crab and defend yourself against incoming sea creatures. Use your mouse wheel to move left and right and aim with the WASD controlled crosshairs. Left-click to strike at your enemy. Be careful about losing health points. If you don't have any left, a deadly salmon will come and take you away.

This was inspired by arcade video games. Try to stay alive as long possible for the highest score you can get.
